This is my Flask web application hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk: http://flask-web-evn.eba-2xusf33v.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/. I'm interested in how does President Trump feel after he lose the election so I built a website to update his top 20 most recent tweets and perform sentiment analysis on them every 7 hour. 


## Motivation
